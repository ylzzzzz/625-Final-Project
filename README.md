Impact of Cross-Cohort Heterogeneity on Differential Gene Expression and Feature Selection in Alzheimer’s Disease

Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease is associated with widespread alterations in gene expression, and bulk gene expression studies have been widely used to investigate disease-related molecular changes in human samples. To improve statistical power and generalizability, data from multiple independent cohorts are often integrated; however, such integration is challenged by cross-cohort heterogeneity arising from differences in brain region or tissue source, experimental platforms, and preprocessing pipelines.
In this study, we investigate the impact of cross-cohort heterogeneity on differential gene expression analysis and exploratory feature selection in Alzheimer’s disease. Using normalized bulk gene expression data from eight independent cohorts, we first performed differential expression analyses within each cohort to characterize cross-cohort heterogeneity. We then conducted pooled differential expression analyses on the merged dataset both without and with cohort adjustment to evaluate the impact of batch effects. Finally, robustness of gene–disease associations was assessed by examining consistency of effect direction and exploratory feature selection across cohorts.
Our results show that cohort adjustment substantially alters differential expression findings, while a subset of genes exhibits consistent disease-associated patterns across heterogeneous cohorts. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for cross-cohort heterogeneity and evaluating robustness when integrating multi-cohort gene expression data in Alzheimer’s disease research.
