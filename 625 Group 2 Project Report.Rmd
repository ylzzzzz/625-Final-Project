## 1 Abstract

Alzheimer’s disease is associated with widespread alterations in gene expression, and bulk gene expression studies have been widely used to investigate disease-related molecular changes in human samples. To improve statistical power and generalizability, data from multiple independent cohorts are often integrated; however, such integration is challenged by cross-cohort heterogeneity arising from differences in brain region or tissue source, experimental platforms, and preprocessing pipelines. In this study, we investigate the impact of cross-cohort heterogeneity on differential gene expression analysis and exploratory feature selection in Alzheimer’s disease. Using normalized bulk gene expression data from eight independent cohorts, we first performed differential expression analyses within each cohort to characterize cross-cohort heterogeneity. We then conducted pooled differential expression analyses on the merged dataset both without and with cohort adjustment to evaluate the impact of batch effects. Finally, robustness of gene–disease associations was assessed by examining consistency of effect direction and exploratory feature selection across cohorts. Our results show that cohort adjustment substantially alters differential expression findings, while a subset of genes exhibits consistent disease-associated patterns across heterogeneous cohorts. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for cross-cohort heterogeneity and evaluating robustness when integrating multi-cohort gene expression data in Alzheimer’s disease research.

## 2 Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and widespread molecular alterations in the brain. Bulk gene expression profiling has been widely used to investigate transcriptional changes associated with AD and to identify candidate genes and pathways implicated in disease pathology. Over time, a large number of transcriptomic studies have been generated across diverse cohorts, brain regions, and experimental platforms. While this diversity reflects the biological complexity of Alzheimer’s disease, it also poses substantial challenges for reproducibility and cross-study comparison. Reported disease-associated genes often vary considerably between studies, in part due to differences in brain region or tissue source, experimental platforms, preprocessing pipelines, and sample characteristics. These sources of heterogeneity introduce both biological variation and technical batch effects—systematic differences unrelated to the underlying disease process—that can distort gene–disease associations if not properly addressed. Rather than treating cross-cohort heterogeneity solely as a limitation, integrating multiple independent cohorts provides an opportunity to assess the robustness of gene–disease associations under realistic biological and technical variation. From this perspective, consistency—or lack thereof—across cohorts is itself informative. Even when overlap in identified genes is limited, such results can highlight the extent to which disease-associated signals depend on cohort-specific factors and underscore the importance of appropriate batch handling and robustness evaluation.


Because disease status is known for all samples and the sample size is not large enough, the objective of this study is not prediction but statistical inference: identifying genes whose expression levels differ between AD and non-disease samples and evaluating the stability of these associations across cohorts. We therefore focus on understanding how cohort-level batch effects influence differential expression results and whether disease-associated signals persist.


In this study, we examined gene–disease association analyses in Alzheimer’s disease using multiple independent cohorts. We first characterized differential gene expression between AD patients and controls within individual cohorts. We then evaluated the impact of cross-cohort integration by performing pooled analyses with and without cohort adjustment. Finally, we assessed the robustness of disease-associated signals by examining consistency of effect direction and gene prioritization across cohorts using complementary analytical approaches. By framing cross-cohort integration as a step toward building reference resources that leverage heterogeneous datasets while accounting for batch effects, this work aims to provide methodological insight into identifying reproducible molecular signals in Alzheimer’s disease transcriptomic studies.

## 3 Methods

## 3.1 Data Sources and Preprocessing

Normalized bulk gene expression data were obtained from the GenoTEX benchmark dataset provided through Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/haoyangliu14/genotex-llm-agent-benchmark-for-genomic-analysis/data#dataset), which compiles publicly available gene expression studies from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). All expression values were log-transformed and normalized by the original studies, and no additional normalization was performed. We initially identified eight Alzheimer’s disease–related cohorts, each provided as a separate CSV file corresponding to a single GEO series (e.g., GSEXXXXXX.csv). Within each cohort file, rows represent individual samples indexed by sample identifiers, and columns include sample-level metadata and gene expression measurements. Metadata variables consisted of a binary Alzheimer’s disease indicator (1 = Alzheimer’s disease, 0 = control), age, and gender, while the remaining columns corresponded to normalized gene expression values for a common set of genes across cohorts.

The cohorts differed in experimental platform, study design, and brain region of origin, including middle temporal gyrus, frontal cortex, and temporal cortex. To ensure adequate statistical power for differential expression analysis, cohorts with fewer than 50 total samples were excluded from pooled analyses. As a result, three cohorts (GSE137202, n = 30; GSE139384, n = 12; and GSE214417, n = 24; GSE185909, n = 35) were removed. The final analysis included four independent cohorts: GSE109887 (n = 78), GSE122063 (n = 100), GSE132903 (n = 195), and GSE243243 (n = 93). For pooled analyses, the four retained cohorts were merged after harmonizing gene features across studies. Genes with more than 50% missing values were removed, and remaining missing expression values were imputed using gene-wise median values, resulting in the finalized dataset Alzheimers_Disease_cleandata_final.csv used for pooled analyses before and after handling batch effect.

Because the retained cohorts originate from independent studies and span multiple brain regions and experimental platforms, substantial cross-cohort heterogeneity is expected. In pooled analyses, cohort identity was therefore treated as a batch variable to account for technical and study-specific effects, while brain region information was used to contextualize biological heterogeneity rather than as an explicit modeling covariate.

## 3.2 Differential Expression Analysis Within Cohorts

Differential gene expression analysis (DEA) was first conducted separately within each cohort to characterize cohort-specific Alzheimer’s disease (AD) transcriptional patterns. Analyses were performed using gene-wise linear models implemented in the `limma` package.

For each gene \( g \) and sample \( i \), normalized log-expression values were modeled as

\[
y_{ig} = \beta_{0g} + \beta_{1g}\,\text{AD}_i + \varepsilon_{ig},
\]

where \( \text{AD}_i \) indicates disease status. Empirical Bayes variance moderation was applied to stabilize gene-wise variance estimates across the high-dimensional expression space. Statistical significance was assessed using moderated \( t \)-statistics with Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) control.

## 3.3 Pooled Differential Expression Analysis and Batch Effects

To evaluate the impact of cross-cohort batch effects, gene expression data from all retained cohorts were pooled and analyzed both without and with cohort adjustment. Batch effects were addressed using a linear-model–based adjustment in `limma`, treating cohort identity as a batch variable while preserving disease-associated variation. Differential expression analysis was then repeated on the batch-corrected data.

The batch-adjusted model can be expressed as

\[
y_{ig} = \mu_g + \alpha_{b(i)g} + \beta_{1g}\,\text{AD}_i + \varepsilon_{ig},
\]

where \( \alpha_{b(i)g} \) denotes the cohort-specific effect. Dimensionality reduction using UMAP was applied before and after batch correction to assess changes in cohort-driven structure.

## 3.4 Cross-Cohort Robustness Analysis

To assess robustness of disease-associated signals, we examined consistency of effect direction across cohorts for genes identified in pooled analyses. In addition, Random Forest classifiers were fit within each cohort as an exploratory complement to DEA to evaluate gene importance under a nonparametric framework.

Random Forest models predict disease status using an ensemble of decision trees,

\[
\hat{f}(X_i) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T f_t(X_i),
\]

and gene importance was quantified using permutation-based measures. Overlap in prioritized genes across cohorts was used as an exploratory indicator of cross-cohort robustness.

## Results

### Differential Expression Without and With Batch Adjustment

Differential expression analysis without cohort adjustment identified a large number of genes associated with Alzheimer’s disease. After adjusting for cohort-level batch effects, the number of differentially expressed genes decreased substantially, indicating that technical variation influenced unadjusted results.

### Robust Disease-Associated Genes

Despite batch adjustment, a subset of genes remained significantly associated with disease status. These genes exhibited consistent directions of expression change and included several previously reported in Alzheimer’s disease literature.

### Cross-Cohort Consistency

Analysis of cohort-specific results revealed that while statistical significance varied across cohorts, many genes showed consistent direction of effect. This pattern was observed even in smaller cohorts, suggesting that directional consistency provides additional evidence of robustness beyond significance alone.


## Conclusion
[This project involved several computational challenges typical of high-dimensional genomic analyses, including integrating multi-cohort gene expression data, handling batch effects and missing values, and fitting thousands of gene-wise models efficiently. Techniques from Biostat 625 were applied to address these challenges, including regression-based batch adjustment, empirical Bayes variance stabilization, feature filtering and imputation, and matrix-based computation for scalable modeling. Additional robustness analyses compared differential expression results across cohorts and modeling approaches, highlighting the importance of careful computational design in large-scale transcriptomic studies.]

This study demonstrates that cohort-level batch effects have a substantial impact on differential gene expression analysis in Alzheimer’s disease. Adjusting for cohort identity alters both the number and composition of disease-associated genes, underscoring the importance of accounting for technical heterogeneity in multi-cohort studies. 

Beyond batch adjustment, evaluating consistency of gene expression changes across cohorts provides a complementary perspective on robustness, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous sample sizes. Together, these findings highlight the need for careful modeling and interpretation when drawing biological conclusions from integrated transcriptomic datasets.
